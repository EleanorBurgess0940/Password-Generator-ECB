# Password-Generator-ECB

# Where I began

I started working on this project by sketching it out using paper and pencil. I found that after doing that the first important step was to get the length of the users password. 

I then wrote a prompt to ask how long the user would like their password. As it had to fall between 8-128 characters any thing else would prompt that it had to be in that range.

# Next Steps

The next steps i had to take was to grab the character sets that the user wanted to use. The variables for the sets had to be set and prompts needed to be written that asked the user which character sets they wanted to use. 

# Final Steps

The final thing i did was create a "for loop" that would take the character sets that were selected earlier and generate random characters for the length of password. 

# What Went Wrong

I did have some problems with the logistics of this project. I tried to take it step by step and i kept going a little to far with one step and it would stop working.
